# CUSTOMER CHURN  PREDICTION ( ML Project-3 )
To develop a model for predicting customer churn in a subscription-based service or business, follow these steps:

1. Data Collection: Gather historical customer data, including churn labels and relevant features such as usage behavior (e.g., frequency, duration) and customer demographics (e.g., age, gender, location).

2. Data Preprocessing: Cleanse the data by handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies. Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and correlations of features.

3. Feature Engineering: Create new features that may enhance the predictive power, such as churn rate in the last few months or customer tenure.

4. Data Splitting: Divide the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

5. Model Selection: Experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting, which are suitable for binary classification problems.

6. Model Training: Fit the chosen models to the training data and tune hyperparameters to optimize their performance.

7. Model Evaluation: Assess the models using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test data.

8. Model Comparison: Compare the performance of the models to select the best one based on the chosen evaluation metrics.

9. Interpretability (Optional): For transparency, analyze feature importance or use model-agnostic interpretability techniques to understand the factors influencing churn predictions.

10. Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model into the production environment to make real-time churn predictions for new customers.

11. Monitoring and Refinement: Continuously monitor the model's performance in production, collect feedback, and update the model as needed to ensure its effectiveness in predicting customer churn.
